Major trading partners: exports: E.U., U.S., Japan; imports: E.U., U.S., Japan. South Africa was originally inhabited by San and related peoples. Bantu peoples, including the Zulu and Xhosa, migrated to the region beginning around the 15th century and established large native kingdoms. The Portuguese explorer Bartholomew Diaz discovered and named the Cape of Good Hope in 1488. The Dutch East India Company established a permanent settlement at Cape Town in 1652, which served as a supply and transshipment point for Dutch trade to the East Indies. It attracted Protestant settlers from throughout Western Europe. In a series of wars, the Xhosa people were expelled from the area under Dutch rule. Great Britain began to dispute Dutch control of the Cape of Good Hope region in the late 18th century. To escape increasing British hegemony, in 1836 many Dutch farmers undertook the Great Trek, a northward migration to lands not under the control of any European power. These Afrikaner pioneers later became known as Boers (farmers). They came into conflict with the Zulu kingdom that, under King Shaka, had recently widened its dominion in the South African interior. The Zulus were defeated at the Battle of Blood River in 1838, but they retained substantial power and territory for another 40 years. Great Britain formally took control of the Cape Colony in 1841 and annexed Natal in 1843. The other two Afrikaner provinces, the Orange Free State and the Transvaal, remained free of British control. But when diamonds were discovered in the Orange Free State in 1867 and gold in the Transvaal in 1886, an influx of British miners and entrepreneurs provoked Boer rebellions. In 1878 the Zulu Kingdom under its last great king, Cetewayo, rebelled against British rule in Natal. British troops attacked Zululand in 1878 and crushed the rebellion in 1879. The first Anglo-Boer War of 1881&#x2013;82 led to total British victory. A renewed uprising led to the Boer War of 1899&#x2013;1902, which was fought with great ferocity between British regular troops and Afrikaner guerrilla forces. The eventual British victory led to the establishment of British rule in all of South Africa and to the formation of the Union of South Africa in 1910. The union became a self-governing state within the British Empire in 1934. South African politics became dominated by friction between British and Afrikaner whites; no effective black participation in government was permitted. The United South African party, led by Jan C. Smuts, advocated cooperation between the two groups and led South Africa to join World War II on the Allied side, over the opposition of the pro-Afrikaner Nationalist party. After the war the Nationalists prevailed and won control of the government in 1948. Racial politics became the country's paramount concern, and the Nationalists introduced the policy of &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D; (separateness), under which racial groups were rigidly defined as white, black, Asian (primarily Indian), and colored (mixed ancestry). Each group was to be kept physically separate and develop its own political institutions within defined areas of residence; mixed neighborhoods, intermarriage, and other relations were prohibited. Blacks, in particular, were restricted by &#x201C;pass laws&#x201D; that allowed them only temporary access to white areas for employment. International condemnation of these policies began almost immediately, as India broke relations with South Africa in 1946 over discrimination against Asians, and South Africa became the focus of mounting protest, U.N. resolutions, and international sanctions beginning in the 1960's. On May 31, 1961, South Africa gave up its dominion status and became a republic; its application for membership in the British Commonwealth was withdrawn in the face of strong opposition. The African National Congress (ANC), organized in 1912, was banned by South African authorities. The imprisonment of its leader, Nelson Mandela, provided a focus for black political protest and nationalist aspirations. Homelands were established under the Promotion of Bantu Self-Government Act of 1959 to further the policy of apartheid by creating separate, but dependent, states for South Africa's blacks. Their form of government was set up in the Black Constitution Act of 1971. The South African government intended that the homelands be regarded as separate nations, but none was ever internationally recognized. The scattered homeland territories comprised only a tiny portion of the total area of South Africa, and tended to include marginal and underdeveloped lands. Residents of the homelands were not considered citizens of South Africa, but rather citizens only of their homeland. As such, they could be considered temporary migrant workers and were therefore ineligible for unemployment and other benefits. An uprising in Soweto in 1976 was put down by South African police and armed forces with the loss of hundreds of lives, providing a further focus of black protest. Pieter Willem Botha was elected president in 1978, pledging to uphold apartheid while seeking solutions to racial problems. In 1983, a majority of white voters approved a new constitution that provided for limited power sharing by coloreds and Asians. Blacks, however, continued to be excluded. In the early 1980's, South African troops intervened in civil wars in Angola and Mozambique and were deployed to counteract growing proindependence rebellions in Namibia. Within South Africa, terrorism and uprisings led by the African National Union grew in intensity in 1983&#x2013;84. A state of emergency was declared in 1985, accompanied by renewed political and economic pressure from abroad. In 1986, Bishop Desmond Tutu, a leading black nationalist, addressed the United Nations and called for renewed sanctions. The Botha government announced an end to the pass laws and promised limited black participation in government. Fighting among black groups in 1986&#x2013;87 further increased domestic tension. On May 19, 1986, South African troops conducted raids against ANC bases in Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Botswana. A new national state of emergency was declared as strikes and riots marked the 10th anniversary of the Soweto uprising. The U.S. announced measures designed to end American investment in South Africa. In early 1989, in anticipation of elections to be held in September, various proposals were put forward for constitutional reform. Most called for expanded power sharing but still within the context of defined racial groups. In July 1989 Pres. Botha had an unprecedented meeting with Nelson Mandela, amid strong suggestions that the white government was seeking an accommodation with the antiapartheid leadership. Botha's successor, F.W. de Klerk, continued that policy. A series of measures in 1989&#x2013;90 resulted in the partial dismantling of apartheid, against the vehement opposition of the white right wing, but violence between supporters of the ANC and the Zulu Inkatha movement in Natal led to the declaration of a state of emergency in the province. Mandela was released from prison in the spring of 1990 and received a rapturous welcome from South Africa's blacks, and later made a triumphant tour of Western Europe and North America. His glory was short-lived, however, as the struggle for supremacy again erupted in murder and violence between Mandela's ANC and Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party throughout the latter part of 1990 and 1991. At the same time, Pres. de Klerk and Parliament continued to move the nation toward the ending of apartheid by repealing 60 years of segregation in hospitals, libraries, schools, and other public institutions. The government also released other political prisoners and completely repealed the legal foundations of apartheid: the Land Acts of 1913 and 1936, the Group Areas Act, and the Population Registration Act. The United States and other countries began lifting trade sanctions against South Africa in the summer of 1991. In September 1991, de Klerk, Mandela, and Buthelezi, together with 20 smaller antiapartheid groups, signed an accord to end factional violence. De Klerk proposed a new constitution that would provide universal suffrage and create a two-chamber parliament open to all races. The new constitution abolished the black homelands, consolidating them into one large, multiracial South Africa. In March 1992 a referendum of white voters overwhelmingly approved a government proposal to dismantle all forms of apartheid and to conduct talks with black leaders designed to end white-only rule. The new constitution was approved on Nov. 17, 1993, by all of the country's major political parties, except for Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party, which withheld its support until a week before the country's first-ever multiracial elections in April. More than 22 million voters cast ballots. An overwhelming majority chose the 75-year-old Mandela to lead a coalition government that included de Klerk's National party and Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party. In May 1996 South Africa completed the transition to democracy when it approved a permanent constitution to replace the transitional one implemented three years earlier. It created a strong central government, an independent judiciary, and a bill of rights with one of the broadest guarantees of liberty in the world. In addition to freedom of speech, movement, and political activity, the South African Bill of Rights protects rights to adequate food, housing, water, education, and health care. The day after the new constitution was approved, de Klerk and his colleagues in the National party quit their cabinet posts, saying that the government was strong enough to handle &#x201C;robust opposition.&#x201D; In 1997 there were reminders that troubles remain: in February, riots in Johannesburg suburbs by coloreds against discrimination in favor of blacks and in March, a mass rally (which turned violent) in Johannesburg by still-unsatisfied Zulus. Bitter feelings between the Inkatha Freedom Party and Mandela's ANC surfaced again when the Truth and Reconciliation Committee reported testimony linking Inkatha leaders to assasination squads during the apartheid era. On June 2, 1999, South Africa held its second post-apartheid elections: the ANC won a gigantic victory, taking 266 seats in the 400-seat Assembly. An &#x201C;alliance&#x201D; with the one member of the (Indian) Minority Front gave ANC the 2/3 majority that permits it to amend the Constitution. Thabo Mbeki, who replaced Nelson Mandela as party chief in December, was elected unopposed to be his successor as South Africa's president as well. There has been subsequent slippage in ANC popularity. As inflation heats up strikes grow more frequent. In Dec. 2000 local elections the ANC took only 59 percent and a serious bribery scandal is developing over a 1999 $3.5 billion arms deal. And the government's own report of March 2001 highlighted the gravity of South Africa's AIDS crisis. South Africa has the continent's most highly developed economy; it is a fully-developed, capitalist industrial-commercial society with manufacturing, mining, agricultural, service, and other sectors. It remains the world's largest producer of gold, a key source of chromium and other strategic metals, and of gem-quality diamonds. ",

Around us a dozen other Kenyan politicians sat in comfortable armchairs, sipping tea from silver services and gliding from English to Swahili to tribal languages and back again. The décor  dark wood paneling, white concrete pillars and a flying-saucer-like brass-and-steel chandelier  suggested both the Soviet Politburo and a Las Vegas lounge in the Rat Pack era. Lekuton (pronounced LEH-koo-tone), an animated man in his late 30s, had dropped by to catch up on developments in the country’s election campaign. On Dec. 27, Kenyans are voting, for the first time since 2002, to choose a new president and Parliament; Lekuton was in the capital raising money and trying to decide whether to throw his lot in with the government coalition or with the main opposition party. (Kenya’s parties are fluid, and continuous maneuvering takes place during a campaign season.) Lekuton, a rising political star, was being wooed by both sides, which put his constituents in a state of considerable anxiety. The election, meanwhile, was promising to be the most democratic and unpredictable in Kenya’s history: polls showed President Mwai Kibaki slipping behind the challenger, Raila Odinga, a former political prisoner. The prospect of an incumbent president caught in a genuine electoral contest  a nearly unprecedented event in Africa  excited Lekuton. “There’s never been anything like this in Kenyan politics,” he told me.

They home-schooled me for a while, but for the last two years, they have sent me to the International Christian Academy near Bouaké in Ivory Coast. I'm 16.

It costs more if your parents aren't missionaries, so native families have to be pretty wealthy to send their kids. Over all, the school has a strong American identity. We used to play soccer and basketball with school teams and some clubs from Bouaké, but we didn't go off campus often. We had everything we needed. The school is a comfortable place. It's a little America in the middle of West Africa.",

Mr. Zuma said he had not stated that showers prevent AIDS, explaining that his behavior was an \"additional measure\" to ward off infection, akin to washing one's hands after peeling an onion. Mr. Zuma's statements on H.I.V. and women's sexual behavior were assailed by women's and AIDS activists but supported by many in South Africa's large Zulu population. MICHAEL WINES (NYT)",

Supporters of the African National Congress say the allegations are simply an attempt to draw attention away from the prosecutor's own investigation into whether Mr. Zuma accepted a $71,000 bribe from a French arms company.

They will face each other in a vote scheduled for no sooner than Feb. 7. Election observers said that redoing the legislative vote, which took place simultaneously with the presidential vote, would be costly. Candidates were puzzled by the court’s decision. “This is illogical,” said Lydie Nzengou, the communications officer for Karim Meckassoua, a presidential candidate. “Why would the results for the presidential vote be more credible than those of the legislative vote?” ",

The Gulfstream arrived unexpectedly from Venezuela on July 12, 2008, and taxied to a hangar at the adjacent military airbase — where soldiers formed a line and unloaded its contents. The contents, reportedly more than a half-ton of cocaine, vanished. The crew was arrested and released. The army permitted the government to impound the plane only after several days.

Pretoria was named after Andreas Pretorius, an Afrikaner best known for the 1838 Battle of Blood River, so named because the river ran red with the blood of 3,000 Zulus killed by Voortrekkersettlers. Tshwane (pronounced t'SHWAN-ay) is the African name for another local river and for an Ndebele chief who ruled there before the arrival of whites.

The United Nations wants to take over the mission, but so far the Sudanese government has firmly refused to allow United Nations troops to deploy. The Darfur region has grown even more violent in recent months as the dispute over the United Nations force has dragged on. LYDIA POLGREEN (NYT)",

        "lead_paragraph": "A South African man who was charged last Thursday with participating in a trans-Atlantic organ-trafficking network pleaded guilty in Durban to 38 counts of violating the South African law prohibiting the sale of human tissues. The man, Roderick F. Kimberly, had been identified as a potentially key figure in the ring, which linked poor Brazilians willing to sell their kidneys through middlemen to wealthy but desperately sick recipients in South African hospitals. Fourteen people, four of them Israelis, were arrested last week in South Africa and Brazil and charged with trafficking in human organs. The police have suggested that more arrests are imminent. Mr. Kimberly, 58, was fined $40,000 and given a six-year suspended prison sentence for his role in the ring. Michael Wines (NYT)",

The proponents of a comprehensive plan to end Africa's poverty say the solutions are easy. For example, Gordon Brown, Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer, says preventing the deaths of five million children over the next 10 years would cost just $3 more for each new mother in the world's poorest countries. All told, Tony Blair's Commission for Africa calls for $25 billion more in aid to Africa per year.",

A landlocked country in Africa's central region, the Central African Republic is one of the least-developed countries in the world. Most of its people are farmers, and the nation has little manufacturing, few reliable roads, and no railroad. Europeans first came to the area in the early 1800's in their search for slaves, but it was not until 1889 that the French established an outpost as the current capital city of Bangui. The region was organized as the territory of Ubangi-Shari five years later. In 1910 it was incorporated into French Equitorial Africa along with what are now the countries of Chad, the Congo, and Gabon. The country was granted internal selfgovernment by the French under its present name in 1958 and became a member of the French Overseas Community. Independence was achieved on Aug. 13, 1960. The first prime minister, Barthelemy Boganda, was killed in an airplane crash in 1959 and was succeeded by his nephew, David Dacko. Dacko was elected to a seven-year term in January 1964, but an army coup in 1966 overthrew his government. The head of the army, Jean-Bedel Bokassa, was installed as president. Named president for life in 1972, in 1976 Bokassa declared himself emperor and changed the name of the country to the Central African Empire. Dacko returned to power in 1979, however, and Bokassa went into exile in France. The name of the country was changed back to the Central African Republic. A multiparty political system was reinstated in March 1981, but army officers threw Dacko out of office again six months later and banned all political parties. Opposition parties were legalized in 1991, and Bokassa was released shortly before elections in 1993, elections that made Ange F&#xE9;lix Patass&#xE9; president. He tried to reduce the army's power but has been met with several rebellions requiring the intervention of peacekeepers from neighboring states. After surviving numerous coup attempts, Patass&#xE9; was overturned in March 2003 by fired army head General Francois Bozize who suspended the constitution and proclaimed himself president. ",

On the Rue Legouve and the Passage des Marais, locals recently traced thick chalk circles around dog excrement on their sidewalks - some 200 circles in all - or, in a bit of provocative street art, encircled canine leavings with strands of spaghetti, quartered tomatoes and lettuce leaves. In case City Hall didn't get wind of the happening, a letter was mailed to the mayor asking for \"subsidies for the purchase of boots so that we might walk in the street.\" Paris now spends about 42 million francs a year on the bright green motorcycles used to vacuum up 3.5 tons of excrement each day. But that is only 14 percent of the total. One cautious walker has suggested that the offending pet owners be required to attend obedience courses.",

Now they sell for up to 4,000 Deutsche marks (about $2,800) apiece. So great is demand that the longtime automaker, now privatized, has decided to offer a \"Last Edition\" Trabi, reports the weekly Der Spiegel. Production ended in April 1991, but 444 of the cars were found moldering in a Turkish port, abandoned by a bankrupt importer. Brought back to Germany, they have been repainted, fitted with four- cylinder motors instead of the standard two-, and equipped with imitation leather seats.

The policy will be similar to one offered heavy smokers. To qualify, people will probably have to be 20 percent to 25 percent above the average weight expected for their height, The Sunday Times reports. But at 65, they would receive at least £1,000 ($1,500) more each year than their leaner counterparts. Some critics say the policy could encourage obesity in a country where half of adults already are overweight. But a spokesman for one group, Diet Breakers, disagreed, saying, \"This is one of the few instances which rewards being large in our thin-obsessed society.\"",

Although American stardom eluded him, he went on to establish himself as a top-of-the-line musical theater performer in his homeland while continuing to pay visits to the United States. ",

The New South Wales state police said in a statement on Friday that “there is no reasonable prospect for a successful conviction.” Mr. Henson’s images captured headlines after officers shut down the exhibition, saying they had received complaints. Australia’s prime minister, Kevin Rudd, called the photos “absolutely revolting,” while more than 40 prominent people in the arts, including the actress Cate Blanchett, signed an open letter in support of Mr. Henson. The artist said in a statement that it had been “profoundly humbling to witness the depth of support” for his work in the last few weeks. “It is reassuring to see existing laws, having been rigorously tested, still provide a framework in which debate and expression of ideas can occur,” he added.",

But Bobby Godsell, AngloGold's chief executive, is asserting that since last week, when Newmont offered 1.70 Australian dollars a share, a drop in its stock price has lowered the value of its offer. The difference between the bids now is marginal, Mr. Godsell said, adding that Normandy's response ''is potentially misleading'' for its shareholders.'' Becky Gaylord (NYT)",

        "lead_paragraph": "RINGARRA By Coral Lansbury. 220 pp. New York: Harper & Row. $15.95. GOTHIC fiction's appeal is rooted in the fear of -and attraction to - the irrational. Relying upon exaggeration and the macabre, the genre slips easily into self-parody (the plot of the first Gothic novel, Horace Walpole's 1764 ''Castle of Otranto,'' all but defies rational summation) and has long inspired such deliberate spoofs as Austen's ''Northanger Abbey'' and Peacock's ''Nightmare Abbey.'' In ''Ringarra,'' Coral Lansbury (Australian-born, now a professor of English at Rutgers University) has attempted to write a straight Gothic novel, undiluted by levity, but leavened by a strong infusion of literary and psychological self-consciousness.",

This contingent, composed of about two hundred well-trained, sun-browned men from the Antipodes, is the first to reach Britain from any section of the imperial realm of King George VI. The squadron, which was schooled in Australia and is operating four-engine Sunderland flying boats, will be attached to the coastal command in the Royal Air Force after the completion of a course of advanced training at a British air base. Though operating under direction of the Royal Air Force, the squadron will retain identity as an Australian unit. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, Dec. 27, 1939",

Often overlooked by travelers as they sprint their way through Australia’s Big Three tourist attractions — the dazzling metropolis of Sydney, the startlingly beautiful Great Barrier Reef and the historic Aboriginal site of Uluru — this laid-back city is a place that takes some time to appreciate. But Melbourne slowly grows on you as you stroll around the immaculately preserved Victorian-era downtown or along the revitalized Yarra waterfront, or linger over a cup of “flat white” in one of trendy cafes on Chapel Street (where the very mention of the name Starbucks is greeted with horror). And in January, at least, it has something that Sydney and those other places don’t: the Australian Open. This is a country that loves its tennis, and for two weeks, this city feels like a nonstop party, one in which the chances that a local hero may finally take the title are debated each night in the pubs and where even a doubles match played on an outside court and featuring unranked players from the former Eastern Bloc will draw a capacity crowd.
